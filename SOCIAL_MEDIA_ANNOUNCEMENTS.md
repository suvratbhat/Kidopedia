Hey everyone! 👋

मैं आप सभी के साथ कुछ share करना चाहता/चाहती हूं...

I made a dictionary app for my child's studies, and I thought - why should only my kid benefit?

So I've made it completely FREE and open source for all Indian parents, especially those in smaller cities where quality education resources are expensive or hard to find.

📱 Kidopedia Features:

✅ 100% safe content for kids
✅ Works without internet
✅ Audio pronunciation
✅ Fun learning with games & points
✅ Multiple kids can use one app
✅ No ads, no payments, ever!

🇮🇳 Why I'm doing this:
Quality education tools shouldn't be a luxury. Whether you're in Mumbai or Muzaffarpur, Bangalore or Bhilai - every child deserves the same opportunities.

यह सिर्फ एक app नहीं है, यह एक parent से दूसरे parents को gift है।

Please share with other parents! The more kids we can help, the better. 🙏

🚀 Built it for my kid. Decided to keep it OpenSource and free forever.

Three months ago, my child asked me what a word meant while doing homework. I pulled out my phone to find a safe, simple dictionary app.

What I found instead:
❌ Apps filled with inappropriate content
❌ Complex interfaces confusing for kids
❌ Expensive subscriptions
❌ Data-hungry apps that don't work offline

So I did what any frustrated parent from the Industry  would do - I decide to build one myself.

Named it Kidopedia

A completely free, open-source dictionary app designed specifically for Indian children aged 2-12.

• Age-appropriate content filtering
• Multiple child profiles (perfect for Indian families!)
• Gamified learning (XP, achievements, levels)
• Audio pronunciations
• Works 100% offline
• Zero ads, zero tracking, zero cost,No Login Required

Why Open Source? Why Free?

Here's the thing - I built this for my kid studying in a village. I have the resources and skills because I am from this industry. Love creating!

Every child - whether in South Bengaluru or rural Maharashtra, whether in Cyber Hub Gurgaon or small-town Haryana - deserves access to the same quality of learning tools.

India has 250M+ school going children. Many families dont have time or cant afford. Internet is available fairly but many parents worry about what content their kids are exposed to.

This is my small attempt to level the playing field. Free forever, no monetization plans


 If you're a parent - try it, share feedback
 If you know parents in smaller cities - please share this with them
 If you're a developer - contribute on GitHub

Open to collaboration, feedback, and ideas!

Now let me flex my Hindi :-).

पढ़ाई में मदद के लिए - हर भारतीय बच्चे के लिए, हर शहर से।

"Papa, what does this word mean?"

A simple question from my child. A frustrating 30-minute search for a safe, simple dictionary app that actually works offline.

That's how Kidopedia was born. 📚

🚀 What I built:
A free, open-source dictionary app for kids (2-12 years) with:
• Age-appropriate content only
• Offline functionality
• Audio pronunciations
• Gamified learning
• Zero ads, zero cost

🇮🇳 Why I'm sharing it for free:

I'm privileged to have the skills and resources to build this. But there are millions of parents in tier 2 and tier 3 cities across India who need this more than I do.

Parents in Jhansi, Bilaspur, Rourkela, Nashik, Tirupati - who want the best for their kids but can't afford expensive apps or don't have reliable internet.

This is for them. For their kids. For every Indian child who deserves access to quality learning tools.

📱 100% free. Open source. No strings attached.

Because education shouldn't be a luxury limited to metro cities.

If you know parents who could benefit from this - please share! 🙏

Built with ❤️ for Indian families, by an Indian parent.

From Frustration to Free Education Access: Building Kidopedia

🎯 The Problem:

My kid needed a dictionary for homework. As a parent in urban India, I searched for apps and found:

• Subscriptions costing ₹99-499/month
• Inappropriate content not filtered for children
• Heavy apps that don't work offline
• Ad-ridden experiences

If this was my experience in a metro city with good internet and disposable income, what about parents in tier 2 and tier 3 India?

💡 The Solution:

I built Kidopedia - a completely free, open-source dictionary app for Indian children.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
• React Native + Expo (cross-platform)
• Supabase (backend + auth)
• SQLite (offline-first architecture)
• TypeScript (type safety)
• Custom content filtering algorithms
• Text-to-speech integration

✨ Features Designed for Indian Context:

1️⃣ Offline-First Architecture
Because internet connectivity is still a challenge in many parts of India. Kids can learn without constant connectivity.

2️⃣ Lightweight APK
Built to work on budget Android phones, not just flagship devices.

3️⃣ Multi-Child Profiles
Indian families often share devices among siblings. Each child gets their own progress tracking.

4️⃣ Zero Monetization
No ads, no subscriptions, no data collection. Just pure learning.

5️⃣ Age-Based Content Filtering
Ensures 5-year-olds and 12-year-olds see appropriate content.

🇮🇮 The Mission:

This isn't just another app. It's about digital equity.

• 65% of India's population lives outside metro cities
• 250M+ school children across India
• Many families earning ₹15,000-30,000/month

For these families, ₹99/month for an education app is significant. For their kids to compete with metro city peers, they need access to the same tools - free.

📊 Impact Goals:

✅ Reach 10,000+ families in tier 2 & tier 3 cities
✅ Support kids in Hindi belt regions
✅ Enable learning in areas with poor connectivity
✅ Create a model for free, quality EdTech

🤝 Call for Collaboration:

I'm looking for:
• Developers to contribute (open source on GitHub)
• Educators to provide feedback
• NGOs working in education space
• Anyone who can help spread this to parents in smaller cities

🎁 Why Free? Why Open Source?

Because I have the privilege of skills and resources. Not everyone does.
Because education is a right, not a premium service.
Because tier 2 and tier 3 India deserves the same quality as tier 1.
